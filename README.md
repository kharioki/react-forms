### React Forms

In this project, I demonstrate three major types of react forms one may build:

* **Vanilla react form** - just a vanilla form with no extra packages
* **formik form** - form built with formik
* **autosuggest form** - with auto-suggest in react.

These forms cover:
* Data
* Validation
* Submission
